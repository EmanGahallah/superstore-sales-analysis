## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Power BI**
- **Excel** (initial review)
- **GitHub** (for version control and portfolio)

## Key Insights

- The **Furniture** category had high sales but low profit, mainly due to losses in sub-categories like **Tables** and **Bookcases**.
- Some sub-categories were operating at **negative margins**, requiring deeper pricing and cost reviews.
- Strong **seasonal sales patterns** were observed, with peaks in **November** (likely due to Black Friday) and drops in **January/February**.
